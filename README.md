# Competitive_Prog

Some time back I realized I enjoy solving code-jam problems. So, I decided to create this repository to keep track of the problems I have solved. 
I'll try to add question detail as comments in the file. 

Files can be compiled using g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall sample_file.cpp -o sample_file

Note: Not all of them work correctly.
